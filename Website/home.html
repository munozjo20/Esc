        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            I'm a recent college graduate from Oregon State University. I graduated with a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. My hobbies include soccer, basketball, hiking, and exercising! I have a dog name Zuko which of 2 years of age currently. Recently, I've grown more fond of coding instead of the hardware side of computers. I decided that I need to dive deeper into this field because of my increase fondness of coding which wasn't always the case. When I first started to code I really was clueless and struggled significantly with simple problems presented to me in class. As time went on I took more class in computer science and gained a better understanding. I still feel that I have a lot more growing to do but I hope this website shows part of the skills I've gained on my own.
