                <p>We've created a place to record your workouts from the weight you lifted down to the sets/repetitions you've complated. Lets make notebooks a thing a past by having your workouts saved safely online. Look back at old workouts and see the progress you've made.</p>

                <h2>How did this site come to be?</h3>
                <p>For the longest time I, Jose Munoz, struggled to find an app or page where I could record my numbers for the day at the gym. I didn't want to carry a notebook around because I felt this was annoying or I'd be worried something would happen to the notebook. Perhaps, the biggest issue would be that I would forget it at home. I figured there would be an app out there that resolve this issue but I didn't find one or they were hidden behind fees I personally didn't want to pay. So I started developing this page and possible future app to fill that need. I hope after it is all said and done that this will be something to help me but also help other reach goals and see their progress on their fitness journey.</p>
